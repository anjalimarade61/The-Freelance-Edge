The market growth is primarily driven by increasing consumer awareness of the health benefits of refreshing ointments, which are widely used for pain relief, respiratory issues, and headaches. Additionally, the growing demand for natural and herbal products in the personal care and wellness sectors is further contributing to the market's expansion.
